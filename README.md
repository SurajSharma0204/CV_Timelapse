Hi Everyone,

My name is Suraj Sharma.

I have created timelapse youtube video day, evening and night frame percentage computervision project.

I have used below libraries to download youtube video and for coding.

opencv-python
matplotlib
numpy
yt-dlp


This project classifies video frames into three categories based on brightness using the HSV color model, specifically focusing on the "Value" (V) channel, which represents brightness.

I used dynamic thresholds based on the maximum brightness value to adjust classifications.

Higher percentage shows day, evening percentage is lower due to lighting condition, while night percentage is higher due to contrast lighting.
